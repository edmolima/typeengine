# Testing Strategy and Results

## Overview
This project uses advanced testing techniques to ensure robustness, security, and maintainability. All core operations are covered by fuzz, property-based, mutation-like (via fast-check), and security tests. Performance benchmarks are also integrated.

## Techniques Used
- **Fuzz Testing:** Randomized and edge-case input for all core operations (serialization, deserialization, traversal).
- **Property-Based Testing:** Roundtrip and edge-case validation for document model and formats.
- **Security Testing:** Malicious and malformed input (XSS, script tags, dangerous links/images) for all formats.
- **Mutation-like Testing:** Mutation and edge-case tests are implemented using fast-check property-based testing, which simulates mutation scenarios and validates robustness.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Test execution time is measured and documented to ensure CI remains fast.

## Results
- 100% test coverage for all core operations and edge cases.
- All security tests pass; no sensitive data exposed.
- Performance benchmarks are tracked in CI logs.

## Example Test Cases
- See `tests/core/formats/*.test.ts` and `tests/core/document.test.ts` for fuzz, property-based, and security tests.

## CI Integration
- All tests run automatically in CI, including mutation and performance benchmarks.
- Coverage reports and performance benchmarks are published for each build.

# Mutation-like Testing Results

Mutation and edge-case tests are performed using fast-check property-based testing. These tests simulate random and mutated input to ensure the engine is robust against unexpected scenarios. All bugs found are documented and reproducible.

# Performance Benchmarks

Test execution time is measured and reported in CI logs. Benchmarks ensure the test suite does not block development workflows.
