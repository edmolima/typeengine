# ADR 013: Security and Privacy Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Typeengine is designed for use in sensitive, enterprise, and open-source environments. Security and privacy are product deliverables, not just technical features.

## Decision
Typeengine will:
- Enforce permission models and sandboxing for all plugins and extensions
- Never log or expose sensitive user data in analytics or traces
- Provide opt-in analytics and privacy-respecting observability hooks
- Respond rapidly to security vulnerabilities and provide coordinated disclosure
- Document all security policies and practices for users and contributors

## Consequences
- Typeengine is suitable for regulated, privacy-sensitive, and enterprise deployments
- Users and integrators can trust the engine for secure document processing
- Security is a product promise, not just a technical implementation
