# ADR 012: API Guarantees and Stability

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Enterprise and open-source users require confidence that the Typeengine API will remain stable, predictable, and upgradeable over time. API guarantees are essential for long-term adoption and integration.

## Decision
Typeengine will:
- Version all public APIs and document changes in the changelog
- Announce and deprecate breaking changes in advance
- Provide automated upgrade tooling and migration guides
- Enforce semantic versioning for all releases
- Maintain a central, typed entrypoint for all core exports

## Consequences
- Users can safely upgrade Typeengine without fear of breaking changes
- Integrators and plugin authors have clear migration paths
- API stability is a core product promise, not just a technical detail
