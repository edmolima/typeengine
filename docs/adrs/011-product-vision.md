# ADR 011: Product Vision and Core Deliverables

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Typeengine aims to be the foundation for next-generation rich text and document editing platforms, serving both enterprise and open-source communities. The product vision is to deliver a core engine that is:
- Extensible and plugin-driven
- Deterministic and auditable
- Secure and permissioned
- Fast, scalable, and analytics-ready
- API-stable and upgrade-friendly

## Decision
Typeengine will focus on delivering:
- A universal plugin system for runtime, WASM, and remote extensions
- Immutable, functional document model with lossless serialization/deserialization
- Deterministic transforms and replay/audit capabilities
- Modular validation and migration utilities
- Built-in benchmarking, tracing, and observability hooks
- Automated upgrade tooling and changelog generation
- Security, permission, and sandboxing for all extensions
- World-class documentation, guides, and migration support

## Consequences
- Typeengine is positioned as a drop-in replacement for legacy engines and a foundation for new platforms
- All features are designed for extensibility, auditability, and enterprise adoption
- Technical choices (e.g., TypeScript, modular architecture) are driven by product goals, not by technology trends
