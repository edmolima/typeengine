# ADR 015: Upgrade and Migration Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Typeengine must support seamless upgrades and migrations for users, integrators, and plugin authors. Upgrade tooling and migration guides are product deliverables to ensure long-term adoption and stability.

## Decision
Typeengine will:
- Provide automated upgrade scripts and changelog generation for all breaking changes
- Document migration paths and provide example migration scripts
- Announce and support deprecations with clear timelines
- Ensure all migrations are idempotent and reversible
- Integrate upgrade and migration support into documentation and CI workflows

## Consequences
- Users can upgrade Typeengine with confidence and minimal disruption
- Migration is a supported, documented, and automated process
- Upgrade strategy is a product commitment, not just a technical tool
