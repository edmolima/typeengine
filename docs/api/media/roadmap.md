# üó∫Ô∏è typeengine Roadmap

This document tracks the planned features and milestones for the typeengine project.

---

## Core Library (typeengine-core)

**Goal:** Deliver the world‚Äôs fastest, most extensible, and developer-friendly immutable document engine for rich text‚Äîsetting a new standard for reliability, flexibility, and integration.


### v1 Milestones

- [x] Immutable, extensible document model (structural sharing, zero-copy updates)
- [x] Pure functional API with ergonomic TypeScript types (type inference everywhere)
- [x] Unified, tree-shakable entrypoint and modular architecture
- [x] Professional documentation, guides, and live playground
- [x] Community, contribution, and security policies
- [x] Automated CI, release, code quality, and coverage enforcement
- [ ] Lossless serialization/deserialization (JSON, Markdown, HTML, custom formats)
- [ ] Universal plugin system for document transforms and schema extensions
- [ ] Deterministic, reproducible document transforms (for testing, replay, audit)
- [ ] Pluggable schema validation and migration (versioned docs, forward/backward compat)
- [ ] Built-in benchmarking, tracing, and performance analytics
- [ ] Fuzz testing, mutation testing, and property-based tests
- [ ] Public API stability guarantees and upgrade tooling

### Next Steps (Core)

- [ ] Implement lossless, extensible serialization (with custom format hooks)
- [ ] Release universal plugin API for document transforms and schema extensions
- [ ] Ship deterministic transforms and document replay tools
- [ ] Add schema migration/versioning and validation utilities
- [ ] Integrate built-in benchmarking and public performance dashboards
- [ ] Enforce API stability and provide automated upgrade guides
