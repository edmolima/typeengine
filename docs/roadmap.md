# ROADMAP

THIS DOCUMENT TRACKS THE PLANNED FEATURES AND MILESTONES FOR THE TYPEENGINE PROJECT.

---

## CORE LIBRARY (TYPEENGINE-CORE)

**Goal:** Deliver the world's fastest, most extensible, and developer-friendly immutable document engine for rich textâ€”setting a new standard for reliability, flexibility, and integration.

### V1 MILESTONES

- [X] Immutable, extensible document model (structural sharing, zero-copy updates)
- [X] Pure functional API with ergonomic TypeScript types (type inference everywhere)
- [X] Unified, tree-shakable entrypoint and modular architecture
- [X] Professional documentation, guides, and live playground
- [X] Community, contribution, and security policies
- [X] Automated CI, release, code quality, and coverage enforcement
- [X] Lossless serialization/deserialization (JSON, Markdown, HTML, custom formats)
- [X] Universal plugin system for document transforms and schema extensions
- [X] Deterministic, reproducible document transforms (for testing, replay, audit)
- [X] Pluggable schema validation and migration (versioned docs, forward/backward compat)
- [X] Built-in benchmarking, tracing, and performance analytics
- [X] Fuzz testing, mutation testing, and property-based tests
- [X] Public API stability guarantees and upgrade tooling

### NEXT STEPS (CORE)

- [ ] Implement lossless, extensible serialization (with custom format hooks)
- [ ] Release universal plugin API for document transforms and schema extensions
- [ ] Ship deterministic transforms and document replay tools
- [ ] Add schema migration/versioning and validation utilities
- [ ] Integrate built-in benchmarking and public performance dashboards
- [ ] Enforce API stability and provide automated upgrade guides
