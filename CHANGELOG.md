## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9056121: RELEASE 1.0.0

  Typeengine 1.0.0 delivers a world-class, enterprise-ready rich text/document engine:

  - Universal plugin system (runtime, WASM, remote) with sandboxing and permission enforcement
  - Immutable, functional document model with lossless serialization/deserialization (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
  - Deterministic transforms, replay, and audit capabilities
  - Modular validation and migration utilities (versioned, idempotent, reversible)
  - Built-in benchmarking, tracing, and analytics export for performance transparency
  - Automated upgrade tooling and changelog generation
  - Security and privacy model: permissioned plugins, opt-in analytics, no sensitive data exposure
  - API stability guarantees, semantic versioning, and migration guides
  - World-class documentation: README, GUIDE, ROADMAP, RELEASE, ADRs
  - 100% test coverage: property-based, fuzz, mutation, and stress tests
  - Automated CI/CD, code quality, and coverage enforcement
  - Ready for enterprise and open-source adoption

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 909b5c4: - Implements acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) for all serialization formats (HTML, JSON, Markdown) and core logic.
  - Adds comprehensive tests for error cases, plugin hooks, and edge cases to ensure robustness.
  - Ensures full plugin support and extensibility in the core serialization/deserialization engine.
  - Fixes minor type errors in test plugins for improved type safety.
  - Improves maintainability and reliability of the codebase by covering all critical paths and failure scenarios.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- de19cbf: ## Core evolution: architecture, quality, and automation

  - Refactored and documented the roadmap to focus the core on a pure, immutable, extensible document engine, separating all editor/engine concerns into a future package.
  - Enforced 80% minimum code coverage in CI, with robust automated checks.
  - Added typecheck script and improved package.json scripts for quality and reliability.
  - Created and standardized issue and pull request templates (context, why/what, acceptance, quality, security, performance).
  - Added comprehensive entrypoint (index.ts) test to guarantee API integrity and prevent accidental breaking changes.
  - Improved and extended test coverage for error paths and edge cases in core operations (e.g., insertNode).
  - All documentation, contribution, and release processes updated to reflect world-class open source standards.

  These changes make the core ready for adoption by teams and companies seeking a robust, extensible, and future-proof rich text engine.
