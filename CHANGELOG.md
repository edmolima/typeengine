### Minor Changes

- de19cbf: ## Core evolution: architecture, quality, and automation

  - Refactored and documented the roadmap to focus the core on a pure, immutable, extensible document engine, separating all editor/engine concerns into a future package.
  - Enforced 80% minimum code coverage in CI, with robust automated checks.
  - Added typecheck script and improved package.json scripts for quality and reliability.
  - Created and standardized issue and pull request templates (context, why/what, acceptance, quality, security, performance).
  - Added comprehensive entrypoint (index.ts) test to guarantee API integrity and prevent accidental breaking changes.
  - Improved and extended test coverage for error paths and edge cases in core operations (e.g., insertNode).
  - All documentation, contribution, and release processes updated to reflect world-class open source standards.

  These changes make the core ready for adoption by teams and companies seeking a robust, extensible, and future-proof rich text engine.
